A Repository containing a portfolio of my data science projects. 

# Projects
- [Analysis of Bank Marketing Data](https://adamgregg95.github.io) (Python, Spark MLLib, Databricks): Created a classification model to predict whether or not a client will subscribe to a term deposit. After exploring and preprocessing the data, 4 classification algorithms were created. Performances were assessed using Accuracy and AUROC as the evaluation metrics. Random Forest Classifier had the best performance and produced the most optimized model with an AUC score of 0.7871 and an Accuracy of 73.63%.

- [Analysis of German Credit Data](https://github.com/adamgregg95/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/German%20Credit%20Data/Analysis_of_German_Credit_Data.ipynb) (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook): Created a classification model to predict if prospective applicants would be approved a loan or not. Analyzed the data using visualization techniques and preprocessed the data for modelling. Used 3 classification algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression). Logistic Regression was chosen for the predictive model as it had the best performance during the 10-fold cross-validation. Achieved a training and testing score of 79%.
