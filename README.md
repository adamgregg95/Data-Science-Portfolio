- Analysis of Bank Marketing Data(Python, Spark MLLib, Databricks). Created a classification model to predict whether or not a client will subscribe to a term deposit. After exploring and preprocessing the data, 4 classification algorithms were created. Performances were assessed using Accuracy and AUROC as the evaluation metrics. Random Forest Classifier had the best performance and produced the most optimized modelwith an AUC score of 0.7871 and an Accuracy of 73.63%
