A Repository containing a portfolio of my data science projects. 

# Projects
- [Analysis of Bank Marketing Data](https://adamgregg95.github.io) (Python, Spark MLLib, Databricks): Created a classification model to predict whether or not a client will subscribe to a term deposit. After exploring and preprocessing the data, 4 classification algorithms were created. Performances were assessed using Accuracy and AUROC as the evaluation metrics. Random Forest Classifier had the best performance and produced the most optimized model with an AUC score of 0.7871 and an Accuracy of 73.63%.

- [Analysis of German Credit Data](https://github.com/adamgregg95/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/German%20Credit%20Data/Analysis_of_German_Credit_Data.ipynb) (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook): Created a classification model to predict if prospective applicants would be approved a loan or not. Analyzed the data using visualization techniques and preprocessed the data for modelling. Used 3 classification algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression). Logistic Regression was chosen for the predictive model as it had the best performance during the 10-fold cross-validation. Achieved a training and testing score of 79%.

- [Financial Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/adamgregg95/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Financial%20Time%20Series%20Analysis/Financial%20Time%20Series%20Analysis.ipynb) (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook): Analyzed stock market data for Facebook, 3M, IBM, and Amazon over a 60 month period (July 31, 2012 - June 30, 2017). Compared and analyzed auto-correlation plots of the adjusted close and monthly returns for the 4 stocks. Determined the correlation coefficients of the monthly returns for the stocks and displayed these using visualization techniques such as scatter matrices and heat maps. 

- [Census Income Data](https://github.com/adamgregg95/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Census%20Income%20Data/Census_Income_Data.ipynb) (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook): Leveraging US Census data from 1994, created a classification model to predict whether an individual's gross income is greater than/less than 50K annually. Analyzed, transformed and prepared the data for modelling. Assessed the performance of 6 classification models using 10-Fold Cross Validation and used a form of forward Selection with a Chi-square test of independence for feature selection. Logistic Regression had the best performance accuracy and the final model achieved a training and testing score of 82.33% and 81.62% respectively.

- [Quality Predictions in a Mining Process]() (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook): Created a regression model to predict the percentage of silica present in iron ore concentrate. Performed exploratory data analysis, transformed and cleaned the data for modelling. Trained and tested various regression algorithms, and documented performance using RMSE, R^2 and accuracy. The Gradient Boosting Regressor produced the best generalized model.
